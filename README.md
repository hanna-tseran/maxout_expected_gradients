# Expected Gradients of Maxout Networks and Consequences to Parameter Initialization

Official repository for the Expected Gradients of Maxout Networks and Consequences to Parameter Initialization paper.

_Note:_ The figures in the repository are averaged over fewer observations than in the paper to ensure that the code runs quickly. It is necessary to increase the number of observations to the numbers mentioned in the figure descriptions to obtain the same results as in the paper.

All code is written in Python 3.
