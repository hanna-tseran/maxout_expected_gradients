# Expected Gradients of Maxout Networks and Consequences to Parameter Initialization

Official repository for the Expected Gradients of Maxout Networks and Consequences to Parameter Initialization paper.

_Note:_ The figures in the repository are averaged over less observations than in the paper to ensure that the code runs quickly. To obtain the results as in the paper, increase the number of observations to the numbers mentioned in the figure descriptions in the paper.
